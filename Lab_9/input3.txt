I’m sure there’s a whole team of UI designers, programmers, and testers who worked very hard on the 
OFF button in Windows Vista, but seriously, is this the best you could come up with?

Every time you want to leave your computer, you have to choose between nine, count them, nine options: 
two icons and seven menu items. The two icons, I think, are shortcuts to menu items. I’m guessing the 
lock icon does the same thing as the lock menu item, but I’m not sure which menu item the on/off icon 
corresponds to.
On many laptops, there are also four FN+Key combinations to power off, hibernate, sleep, etc. That 
brings us up to 13 choices, and, oh, yeah, there’s an on-off button, 14, and you can close the lid, 15. A 
total of fifteen different ways to shut down a laptop that you’re expected to choose from.
The more choices you give people, the harder it is for them to choose, and the unhappier they’ll feel. See, 
for example, Barry Schwartz’s book, The Paradox of Choice. Let me quote from the Publishers Weekly 
review: “Schwartz, drawing extensively on his own work in the social sciences, shows that a bewildering 
array of choices floods our exhausted brains, ultimately restricting instead of freeing us. We normally 
assume in America that more options (‘easy fit’ or ‘relaxed fit’?) will make us happier, but Schwartz 
shows the opposite is true, arguing that having all these choices actually goes so far as to erode our 
psychological well-being.”
The fact that you have to choose between nine different ways of turning off your computer every time just 
on the start menu, not to mention the choice of hitting the physical on/off button or closing the laptop lid, 
produces just a little bit of unhappiness every time.
Can anything be done? It must be possible. iPods don’t even have an on/off switch. Here are some ideas.
If you’ve spoken to a non-geek recently, you may have noticed that they have no idea what the difference 
is between “sleep” and “hibernate.” They could be trivially merged. One option down.
Switch User and Lock can be combined by letting a second user log on when the system is locked. That 
would probably save a lot of forced-logouts anyway. Another option down.
Once you’ve merged Switch User and Lock, do you really need Log Off? The only thing Log Off gets 
you is that it exits all running programs. But so does powering off, so if you’re really concerned about 
exiting all running programs, just power off and on again. One more option gone.
Restart can be eliminated. 95% of the time you need this it’s because of an installation which prompted 
you to restart, anyway. For the other cases, you can just turn the power off and then turn it on again. 
Another option goes away. Less choice, less pain.
Of course, you should eliminate the distinction between the icons and the menu. That eliminates two 
more choices. We are down to:
Sleep/Hibernate
Switch User/Lock
Shut Down
What if we combined Sleep, Hibernate, Switch User and Lock modes? When you go into this mode, the 
computer flips to the “Switch User” screen. If nobody logs on for about 30 seconds, it sleeps. A few 
minutes later, it hibernates. In all cases, it’s locked. So now we’ve got two options left:
I am going away from my computer now;
I am going away from my computer now, but I’d like the power to be really off
Why do you want the power off? If you’re concerned about power usage, let the power management 
software worry about that. It’s smarter than you are. If you’re going to open the box and don’t want to get 
shocked, well, just powering off the system doesn’t really completely make it safe to open the box; you 
have to unplug it anyway. So, if Windows used RAM that was effectively nonvolatile, by swapping 
memory out to flash drives during idle time, effectively you would be able to remove power whenever 
you’re in “away” mode without losing anything. Those new hybrid hard drives can make this super fast.
So now we’ve got exactly one log off button left. Call it “b’bye”. When you click b’bye, the screen is 
locked and any RAM that hasn’t already been copied out to flash is written. You can log back on, or 
anyone else can log on and get their own session, or you can unplug the whole computer.
Inevitably, you are going to think of a long list of intelligent, defensible reasons why each of these 
options is absolutely, positively essential. Don’t bother. I know. Each additional choice makes complete 
sense until you find yourself explaining to your uncle that he has to choose between 15 different ways to 
turn off a laptop.
This highlights a style of software design shared by Microsoft and the open source movement, in both 
cases driven by a desire for consensus and for “Making Everybody Happy,” but it’s based on the 
misconceived notion that lots of choices make people happy, which we really need to rethink.
